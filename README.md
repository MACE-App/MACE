## About

M.A.C.E. (macOS Advanced Compliance Editor) is a native macOS app that simplifies compliance baseline creation, customization, auditing, and deployment using [NIST's mSCP 2.0](https://pages.nist.gov/macos_security/).

**The problem:** Compliance folks need better tools. The mSCP project is fantastic, but for those of us who are less command-line savvy, customizing baselines can be intimidating. We needed something that makes compliance simple *and* customizable — without requiring scripting knowledge.

**The solution:** M.A.C.E. fills that gap. This is my first app, and I have a lot to learn, but I'm building what I've needed for years: a tool that puts powerful compliance capabilities in a visual, approachable interface. The community decides where it goes next.

**Built for:**
- macOS Security Administrators
- Compliance Officers & IT Audit Teams
- MDM Administrators (Jamf, Intune)
- Government & Enterprise Security Teams

## Status

> **Alpha Release**
> This is an alpha release. Many features are still in development and some are disabled until ready. This release is for early adopters to preview progress and provide feedback.

**Current Focus:**
- Finalizing the compliance builder hub for rule reading and user adjustments
- Building an mSCP-style build engine for customizable enforcement files
- Improving audit export accuracy for MDM platforms

**Known Limitations:**
- Rules may not reflect the latest guidance until mSCP 2.0 is finalized
- Some export formats may have issues with specific MDM platforms (Intune, Jamf)
- mSCP audit engine pending mSCP 2.0 release
- Currently supports American English only

**Feedback:**
- Bug reports are welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MACE-App/MACE/issues)
- Feature suggestions and "nice to have" ideas help guide development

**Website:** A dedicated website with tutorials and usage guides is planned once core features are finalized.

## Community & Feedback

M.A.C.E. is a **community-driven project**. I personally work with STIGs, so many features were built around that workflow but I want this app to work for everyone. Whether you're using CIS, NIST 800-53, CMMC, or something else entirely, your input matters.

**I'd love to hear from you:**
- What compliance frameworks do you use?
- What features would make your workflow easier?
- What's missing or could be improved?
